# Exercise: Exam statistics
---
Creating a program to compute statistics means that you won't have to whip out your calculator and manually crunch numbers. All you'll have to do is supply a new set of numbers and our program does all of the hard work.

This mini-project will give you some practice with functions, lists, and translating mathematical formulae into programming statements.
