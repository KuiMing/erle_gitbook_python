## Bitwise operators basics

Bitwise operations might seem a little esoteric and tricky at first, but you'll get the hang of them pretty quickly.

Bitwise operations are operations that directly manipulate bits. In all computers, numbers are represented with bits, a series of zeros and ones. In fact, pretty much everything in a computer is represented by bits. This course will introduce you to the basic bitwise operations and then show you what you can do with them.

Here is a list with one of the most used bitwise operators. We will explain them and exercise them later on.

|**Bitwise operator**|**Name**|**Execution**|
|---|
|print 5 >> 4 |  Right Shift| 0|
|print 5 << 1  |Left Shift|10|
|print 8 & 5   | Bitwise AND|0|
|print 9 *pipe* 4   | Bitwise OR|13|
|print 12 ^ 42 | Bitwise XOR|38|
|print ~88     |Bitwise NOT|-9|
