Python is an interpreted programming language whose philosophy emphasizes a syntax that encourages readable code.

It is a multi-paradigm programming language, since it supports object-oriented, imperative programming and to a lesser extent, functional programming. It is an interpreted language, it uses dynamic typing and is multiplatform. You can use it to create web apps, games, even a search engine.
